        <h1 class="name">Rohit Sharma Journey To Cricket</h1>
        
        <ul>
            <li>In the initial days of his career, Rohit was coach by Dinesh Lad at the Swami Vivekanand International School, Mumbai. He taught Rohit without any coaching fee.</li><br>
    
            <li>It’s quite surprising that before becoming an opener batsman, Rohit was an off-spinner bowler.</li><br>
            
            <li>In March 2005, Rohit made his List A debut for West Zone against Central Zone in Deodhar Trophy.</li><br>
            
            <li>In the same tournament, Sharma scored an unbeaten inning of 142 in 123 balls against North Zone at Udaipur. This gave Sharma an opportunity to represent India A at Abu Dhabi against Australia.</li><br>
            
            <li>Sharma was also named in the 30 man list for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy tournament but failed to make the squad.</li><br>
            
            <li>Sharma made his India A debut against New Zealand A in a first-class match at Darwin in July 2006.</li><br>
    
            <li>Months later, Rohit made his Ranji Trophy debut for his Mumbai in the 2006–07 season and was a part of the victorious Mumbai team.</li><br>
        
            <li>Rohit Sharma is the most successful captain in the Indian Premier League. He has won the IPL trophy five times, four times as the captain of the Mumbai Indians..</li><br>
        
            <li>Sharma’s IPL campaign started with the Deccan Chargers. He was the vice-captain and a key member of the DC squad which won the coveted trophy in its second season.</li><br>
    
            <li>In 2011, Sharma was purchased by the Mumbai Indians for Rs 20 Lakhs. However, his contribution to the Ambani-owned franchise has been invaluable.</li><br>
        
            <li>In 2015, he led Mumbai Indians to win the IPL title by beating Chennai Super Kings with a margin of 41 runs in the final.</li><br>
        
            <li>Rohit Sharma received his first ODI call-up against Ireland on 23 June 2007. Although he did not get to bat, India won the match by 8 wickets.</li><br>
        
            <li>This time Sharma took his chance as he scored his first ODI century (114) against Zimbabwe followed by another century against Sri Lanka (101*).</li><br>
